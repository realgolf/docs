title: Public Profile

## Username

The username is a unique identifier used to access someone's public profile. It needs to be unique across the platform.

To view someone's public profile using their username, you can append their username to the domain. For example, to access the public profile of user `MoinJulian` on RealGolf.Games, you would use the following URL: `https://realgolf.games/MoinJulian`. Note that the entered username is case-insensitive, so you don't have to worry about differentiating between uppercase and lowercase letters.

## Name

The real name of the user is displayed below the Username in a smaller and greyer font.

**It's important to note that while the displayed name ideally reflects the user's real name, it is not explicitly required to be the real name of the user.**

## Bio

The Bio section provides users with the opportunity to share a brief and personal description about themselves. It serves as a space for users to express their interests, professional background, or any other information they wish to share with the community. Users can use the Bio section to provide context about who they are and what they are passionate about. Keep in mind that the content shared in the Bio section should adhere to the platform's community guidelines and policies.

## Username

The username is a unique identifier used to access someone's public profile. It needs to be unique across the platform.

To view someone's public profile using their username, you can append their username to the domain. For example, to access the public profile of user `MoinJulian` on RealGolf.Games, you would use the following URL: `https://realgolf.games/MoinJulian`. Note that the entered username is case-insensitive, so you don't have to worry about differentiating between uppercase and lowercase letters.
